	<br>
	<p class="leading">Science Night is a series of local science fairs held for kids to learn through various STEM related activities. For nearly a year we have been invited to these science nights to promote the robotics and computer science fields. Through this, we have been able to engage kids in a fun learning environment and introduce them to a field that they have not been exposed to before. Below are some pictures from these trips:</p>

				This time, we were able to bring our robots outside of central Arkansas to the southern Arkansas region. We were able to demo our robots to multiple middle school classes and we were able to generate interest in our robots. We were even asked to come back to do a small workshop for our lego robot right before summer.</p>

				<p>Science night at Bob Courtway went well. We were able to introduce our two newest robots, the Bioloid Premium Robot Kit, and the EZ-Robot. Both garnered attention from the attendees and our both was full for most of the night. For our Bioloid, we had kids interact with it by making it clap a certain number of times, and the EZ-Robot entertained the crowd by dancing and finding markers on its own.</p>

				For this science night we re-configured our EV3 robot from the GRIPP3R to the EV3RSTORM which makes it appear humanoid and gives it a ball launcher. Kids were then tasked at shooting the ball into a small cup to win a prize which is harder than it sounds. Once again, all of our robots stayed busy and we were able to show off the capabilities of our robots.

				On this particular science night we brought along our newest device for kids to play with: Leapmotion. Leapmotion can track users hand movements to do anything from controlling a robotic hand on screen, to sculpting clay into different shapes. Despite the smaller than usual crowd, both the EV3 and the obstacle avoidance robot were still used the entire time we were there. Kids seemed to enjoy the challenge of controlling the EV3 and we had some that would stay for up to 10 minutes trying to grab the can with it.

				For this science night, we were able to introduce our EV3 robot. The Lego Mindstorms EV3 robot is a transformable robot that can be made into any of 5 default designs or any custom design. For this demonstration we had our EV3 setup to the GRIPP3R configuration, which gives it a claw to pick up objects. Kids were able to control the EV3 via bluetooth from our iPhone, and were challenged to pick up a soda can and drop it on a target. Between both the EV3 and the obstacle avoidance robot, our booth stayed busy the entire time.

				We were unable to bring back the box course for the obstacle avoidance robot this time, but kids still seemed to have a lot of fun with the robot regardless. This time we were able to bring another Arduino robot that the kids could control from our laptop. They also enjoyed the game station where they could play difficult games to win candy and prizes.

				Science night at Bob Courtway Middle school was a great success. The kids were great, and we had a lot of interest in our obstacle avoidance robot, which has sensors mounted on its front, left, and right sides to detect obstacles and turn as necessary. We set up an obstacle course to demonstrate how it would avoid running into walls until it found a safe exit. After awhile, we brought the robot out of its course for kids to play with. The kids would try to fool the obstacle avoidance robot and would even huddle around it to try and trap it to no success.

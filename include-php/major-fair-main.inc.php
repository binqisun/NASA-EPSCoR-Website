				At UCA, there is a Major Fair that is held every semester where the various departments talk to undergraduates about their respective major. For this Major Fair we were asked to represent the computer science department and give a demonstration for those that were interested in computer science. We were one of the most popular booths, and we even won grand champion out of all the departments that attended.
